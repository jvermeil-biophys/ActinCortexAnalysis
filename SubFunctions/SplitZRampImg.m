function [Sdown,Smid,Sup,Sramp] = SplitZRampImg(Sfull,nimgbr,nimgr,nimg)

%
% Splits the image list Sfull between list for down, middle and up images
% corresponding to the triplets taken in Z when not in a ramp.  
% And a list of image that are during a ramp. Improvement on SplitZimage
% for the case where there is non-triplet images in the middle of the loop.
%
%
% OUTPUTS : 
% Sdown : list of images that are the first of a Z triplet 
% Smid : list of images that are the second of a Z triplet 
% Sup : list of images that are the last of a Z triplet 
% Sramp : list of images in the ramps
%
% INPUTS :
% Sfull : vector of image numbers to split
% nimgbr : number of images before a ramp in a loop
% nimgr : number of images in a ramp in a loop
% nimg : number of images per loop
